GitReleaseManager configuration can be controlled using a configuration
file, which is typically stored at the root of your project.

GitReleaseManager ships with the following default set of configuration (i.e.
when no yaml file is placed in the root directory):

```yaml
create:
    # Please see
    # https://gittools.github.io/GitReleaseManager/docs/configuration/template-configuration#editing-the-templates
    # configuration for configuring footers
    include-footer: false
    include-sha-section: false
    sha-section-heading: "SHA256 Hashes of the release artifacts"
    sha-section-line-format: "- `{1}\t{0}`"
    allow-update-to-published: false
    include-contributors: false
export:
    include-created-date-in-title: false
    created-date-string-format: ''
    perform-regex-removal: false
    regex-text: ''
    multiline-regex: false
close:
  use-issue-comments: false
  set-due-date: false
  issue-comment: |-

Essentially, the only settings that are enabled by default are those that
specify which labels to include and which to exclude.

Not all options are required. For example, footer-content, is an empty string
by default.

## Create Options

When creating a Release, there are a number of options which can be set to
control the look and feel of the generated release notes.

- **include-footer**
  - A boolean value which indicates that a footer should be included within the
        release notes. Default is false.
- **footer-heading**
  - A string value which contains the heading text for the footer. Default is
        an empty string.
- **footer-content**
  - A string value which contains the main body text for the footer. This can
        be anything. A typical example might be to provide information about where
        the release can be installed from. Default is an empty string.
- **footer-includes-milestone**
  - A boolean value which indicates that the footer content contains a
        milestone, which should be replaced with the actual milestone value. As an
        example, let's say you want to provide a link to where you can download your
        release, and the URL could be something like
        <http://mydomain.com/releases/0.1.0>. You don't want to have to hard code
        the milestone number into your yaml configuration, so instead, you can use
        a replacement string in your footer-content, which will then be replaced
        with the actual milestone release number, when the release is created. Default
        is false.
- **milestone-replace-text**
  - A string value which contains the string which should be replaced in the
        footer-content with the actual milestone release number. Default is an empty
        string.
- **include-sha-section**
  - A boolean value which indicates that the calculated SHA256 hash of the
        assets which are added to a release should be included within the release
        notes. Default is false. **NOTE:** This configuration option was added
        in version 0.9.0 of GitReleaseManager.
- **sha-section-heading**
  - A string value which contains the heading text for the SHA256 hash section.
        Default is `SHA256 Hashes of the release artifacts` **NOTE:** This
        configuration option was added
        in version 0.9.0 of GitReleaseManager.
- **sha-section-line-format**
  - A string value which contains the .Net String Format value which will be
        used when creating the SHA256 hash entries in the release notes.
        Default is ``- `{1}\t{0}` `` **NOTE:** This configuration option was added
        in version 0.9.0 of GitReleaseManager.
- **allow-update-to-published**
  - A boolean value which indicates whether or not updates can be applied to
        published releases. The default value is false. **NOTE:** This
        configuration option was added in version 0.11.0 of GitReleaseManager.
- **include-contributors**
  - A boolean value which indicates whether the list of contributors is included
      in the release notes. A contributor is defined as someone who opened an issue
      or submitted a PR. **NOTE:** This configuration option was added in version
      0.19.0 of GitReleaseManager.

See the [example create configuration section](create-configuration) to see an
example of how a footer can be configured.

## Export Options

- **include-created-date-in-title**
  - A boolean value which indicates whether the date of which a Release occurred
        should be included within the heading section of generated release notes.
        Default is false.
- **created-date-string-format**
  - A string value which contains the Date Time Format string which should be
        used when including the created date in the title of the release notes.
        Default is an empty string.
- **perform-regex-removal**
  - A boolean value which indicates whether a regular expression should be
        performed on the generated release notes to remove some text. Default is
        false.
- **regex-text**
  - A string value which contains the regular expression to match against the
        generated release notes, in order to remove text. Default in an empty string.
- **multiline-regex**
  - A boolean value which indicates that the regular expression should span
        multiple lines. Default is false.

See the [example export configuration section](export-configuration) to see an
example of how the export can be configured.

## Close Options

When it comes to closing a milestone with GitReleaseManager, it is possible to
add a comment to any closed issues that were included within that milestone.
This is useful to inform any users who are subscribed to an issue, that this
feature or bug, has actually been shipped.  It is possible to completely control
the content of the issue comment that is added, as well as replace some
tokenized values, such as milestone, owner, repository, with the actual values.

- **use-issue-comments**
  - A boolean value which indicates whether or not comments are added to any
      closed issues that are included within a milestone, when it is being
      closed.
- **issue-comment**
  - This is a template for what comment should be added to each issue.  Within
      this comment template, it is possible to replace information for example,
      the milestone name, the owner/repository information, etc.
- **set-due-date**
  - A boolean value which indicates whether or not to set the due date of the
      milestone when closing it. The date which it is set to, is the same as the
      date at which the command was run, it is not possible to provide a
      different date. **NOTE:** This configuration option was added in version
      0.19.0 of GitReleaseManager.
