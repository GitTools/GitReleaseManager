# Issues to include

In order to include an issue within the release notes that are generated by GitReleaseManager, each issue within a milestone has to be labelled with one of a set of pre-defined labels.

Out of the box, GitReleaseManager is configured to include issues that are tagged with one of the following labels:

```
issue-labels-include:
- Bug
- Feature
- Improvement
```

<div class="admonition note">
    <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
    <p class="last">
        You can add as many issue labels into this section as required. Any issue, included within a milestone that contains a label specified within this list will be included within the generated release notes.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="admonition attention">
    <p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
    <p class="last">
        All issues assigned to a milestone have to have a label which matches to one listed in the include to exclude sections of the GitReleaseManager.yaml file or the default configuration.
    </p>
</div>
